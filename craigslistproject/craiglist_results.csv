"EQ3 Sofa, 75""","I’ve finally come to terms with this couch being the wrong color with my rug and rest of the room, and it’s time for me to move on.

I’m the second owner, and have had it completely covered in a quilt for a few years, in an attempt to lighten the room. It didn’t look great, I’ll say that, but it did make for effectively zero wear on the sofa/couch during my time with it.

There are a couple of small holes on the seat that look weirdly like cig burns but when I bought the couch, neither the house nor the piece had any kind of smoke smell.

Otherwise, this thing is very comfortable, has nice lines and a pleasant visual texture, but ultimately isn’t right for my room.

I’m selling pretty discounted due to the two 1cm holes, as mentioned and as pictured. For a lot of people, it’s a nonstart, and for a lot of other people, it’s a nonissue.

Feel free to email me questions or reasonable (please) offers. Delivery could happen, priced appropriately.

"Vintage Italian Ship Lantern By G. Bottaro, Geneva","Vintage Italian Ship Lantern by G. Bottaro, Geneva

Design Plus Gallery presents a Vintage Italian Ship Lantern by G. Bottaro, Geneva. This antique Italian ship lantern is a beautiful and ornate piece that exudes a sense of history and craftsmanship. Made of durable copper that is designed to withstand the harsh conditions at sea. The lantern has a cylindrical shape with a domed top and a handle for easy portability. It is further equipped with a glass enclosure to protect the flame from wind and water, ensuring that it remains lit even during stormy weather. This glass, usually made of thick and durable material, can be clear or frosted for a more diffused lighting effect. Inside the lantern, there is a burner that holds a fuel source, such as oil or kerosene, which provides the light. This model has brackets + hooks for mounting the lantern to a wall or rigging on a ship. In worn antique condition.
