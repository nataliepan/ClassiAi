Hi there, I am selling my burgandy leather living room couch to make room for a newer purchase for $200 OBO.

I do not have transportation to have this couch delivered, so please consider a method of transporting this to your house after purchasing.

Dimensions are (approximately) as follows:

L - 68"
D - 44"
H - 36"

Any other questions, please feel free to contact me via text! Five-Five-Nine, Seven-Four-Nine, One Seven Eight Nine.

Thank you
