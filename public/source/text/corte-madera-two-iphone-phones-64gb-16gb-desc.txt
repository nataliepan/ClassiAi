I have two phones available for sale. The battery in the 64GB white/rose gold one is solid and the black/space grey one loses juice much much quicker.\

Both come with the original box and charging brick with no lightning cable or earbuds.\
\
Both are in excellent working condition with no screen cracks.\
\
Both are AT&T former phones. Sim cards have been removed for data privacy purposes.\

$80 - 64 GB white/rose gold - AVAILABLE\
$60 - 16 GB black/space grey - AVAILABLE\
