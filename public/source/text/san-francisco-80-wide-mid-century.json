    "desc": "We've had this couch for three years, but it is in very good condition. Selling because we are looking for a larger couch. Cushions have retained their firmness and shape, no rips or stains, but the velvet-like material shows a little sign of wear (see photos and video). From a smoke-free pet-free home. We unfortunately don't know the brand. 80\" wide, 36\" deep, and 33.5\" high (with cushions, 27\" for just the back of the couch). Pick up only. Not very heavy, but requires larger vehicle due to size.",
