Here is an old couch and chair from my Mom's collection. I haven't a clue as to when they were originally made, but they were professionally reupholstered in the late 90's in a still existing shop (see tag)

The couch is 7 feet wide, 3 feet deep and 34 inches tall.

Cool old pieces and in great shape

$100 for the couch, $50 for the chair
